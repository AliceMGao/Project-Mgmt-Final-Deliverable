# Project-Mgmt-Final-Deliverable
An influenza tracking form plan &amp; proposal covering everything from risk register, stakeholder management, and Gantt chart and more.

This Project Management Plan-Emergent Infectious Influenza Tracking Form pdf was the final package my group and I created detailing a proposal for a Telus PSS project to be deployed over summer into early 2021. My main responsibilities within that project were creating the Business Case, Stakeholder register, sections of the communication plan, Gantt chart for the project, and compiling all documents together into a single final deliverable.

Additionally, I took charge of scheduling and managing team meetings over the course of the project as we discussed and deliberated on the nuances of our proposal. I documented key responsibilities for longer meetings and made them accessible to every group member as a record and reference point for individual progress within our respective sections.
